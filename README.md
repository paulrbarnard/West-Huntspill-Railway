WHR run model live steam and electric locos on their track.

This project was to replace a failing signal system with something a little more flexible
The key modules are the SignalBox which provides the control logic with a track display
and the sensor/lights module that detects the trains and switches the signal lights.

PCB layouts are included in the PCB folder in KiCAD format. Parts lists and UK suppliers are in the excel files in the PCB section.

An overview manual is contained in the .docx file

The PCB layouts and code are released free of charge and can be used or modified in any way you like
No expressed or implied warrenty or gaurentee is made.
